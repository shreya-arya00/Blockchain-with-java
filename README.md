# Blockchain-with-java

Blockchain, a decentralized ledger, can be implemented in Java using a Block class representing data blocks with timestamps, and a Blockchain class managing the chain. 
Each block contains data, a timestamp, a previous block reference, and a hash. 
The blockchain ensures tamper-resistant transaction history. 
Considering an example code which initializes a blockchain with a genesis block and adds subsequent blocks. 
Real-world implementations require additional features like consensus mechanisms and networking for a secure and efficient decentralized system.
